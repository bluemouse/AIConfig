# Documentation Rewrite Checklist

Use this checklist before finishing a rewrite.

## Accuracy

- Statements match the current code.
- Avoid speculation. If uncertain, add “Open Questions”.
- If analysis output is approximate (fallback mode), label it clearly.

## Scope

- Whole project docs stay high-level (modules/boundaries).
- Module docs go deeper (responsibilities, invariants, typical flows).

## Structure and Consistency

- Use a consistent template structure.
- Keep headings scannable.
- Prefer short paragraphs and bullets.

## Diagrams

- Use Mermaid when it clarifies relationships or flow.
- Keep diagrams shallow enough to be readable.

## Navigation

- Include “Related Code” and “Related Documentation”.
- Link to other doc files when helpful.
